      			<p class= "ne">Rigas is a family member since 2017 and ever since then we can not imagine our lifes without him. He is 8 years old and born on the 10th of April and he is very playful but also very naughty. When you first meet him he is not friendly and he barks a lot but when he gets comfortable he is very sweet. We all love him very much and we consider him a member of our family.
